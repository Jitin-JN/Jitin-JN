Hi, I am Jitin👋🏻

In 2020, I began my journey as an **Software Engineer**🧑💻 at **Merkle Inc.** My role centered around data processing, conversion, and formatting, where I transformed unstructured data into structured formats using proprietary tools. It was my first real taste of working with data, and I quickly became fascinated by its transformative potential⚡⚡

As I transitioned into an **Analyst role**, I identified potential customers for strategic campaigns—a process that demanded both precision and creativity. It was in these moments I realized how data could drive business success.

Still, I knew I had more to learn. The desire to deepen my understanding of businesses and analytics led me to pursue a 🎓**Master’s in Business Analytics at Pennsylvania State University, USA**. Along the way, I’ve immersed myself in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, pushing myself to master the tools that can unlock the full power of data.

Now, I’m actively seeking a **full-time job or internship** 🏢where I can apply my skills, keep learning, and contribute to solving real-world problems through data.
