Hi, I am Jitin👋🏻

🎯 **Aspiring Data Analyst | Business Analytics Graduate Student**

## 🚀 My Journey

In 2020, I began my journey as an **Software Engineer**🧑💻 at **Merkle Inc.** My role centered around data processing, conversion, and formatting, where I transformed unstructured data into structured formats using proprietary tools. It was my first real taste of working with data, and I quickly became fascinated by its transformative potential⚡⚡

As I transitioned into an **Analyst role**, I identified potential customers for strategic campaigns—a process that demanded both precision and creativity. It was in these moments I realized how data could drive business success.

Still, I knew I had more to learn. The desire to deepen my understanding of businesses and analytics led me to pursue a 🎓**Master’s in Business Analytics at Pennsylvania State University, USA**. Along the way, I’ve immersed myself in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, pushing myself to master the tools that can unlock the full power of data.
